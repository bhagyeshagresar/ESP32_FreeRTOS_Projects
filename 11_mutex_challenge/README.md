# Mutex Challenge

Starting with the code given below, modify it to protect the task parameter (delay_arg) with a mutex. With the mutex in place, the task should be able to read the parameter (parameters) into the local variable (num) before the calling functionâ€™s stack memory goes out of scope (the value given by delay_arg).
